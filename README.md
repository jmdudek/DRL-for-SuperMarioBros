# About this Repository

This repository contains the code and paper to our (Gerrit Bartels, Thorsten Krause and Jacob Dudek) project in Deep Reinforcment Learning. We investigated benefits of Transfer Learning regarding Soft Q-Networks and Double Deep Q-Networks, as well as an alledged relationship between overfitting and negative transfer. The popular NES game Super Mario Bros. served as a test bed for our research. We propose and executed an experimental setup, provide a ready-to-use implementation and identified and put forth major challenges that future research can build upon. 

Currently under construction. Please try reloading until the project is finished.
